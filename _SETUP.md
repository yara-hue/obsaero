::t2:> [!success]+ **✅ Vault is ready!**::
> Everything is pre-configured. Just follow the steps below.

## ⚡ Setup

1. **Trust the author** when Obsidian asks → enables all plugins
2. That's it. Seriously.

### How sync works

- **Auto-pull** on every startup (you get the latest)
- **Auto-commit + push** every 10 minutes (your changes go up)
- **Auto-pull** every 10 minutes (teammates' changes come down)

### ⚠️ Merge conflicts (normal!)

If two people edit the same file at the same time, Git auto-merges silently 90% of the time. When it can't, Obsidian Git creates **`conflict-files-obsidian-git.md`** listing the files to fix. Open them, pick which version to keep, and close. That's it.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|------|
| Git not found | Install Git from https://git-scm.com and restart Obsidian |
| Plugins not loading | Close vault → reopen → click "Trust author" |
| Something broken | Just ask the team |
